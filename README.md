# House-Price-Prediction-Model-with-PySpark

This program builds a model to predict how much a house sells for with PySpark.

The dataset we have is a sample of homes that were sold in St Paul, MN area over the course of 2017.
Using this sample, we are to provide a quick proof of concept of whether it is worth investing in more data for the 5.5 milion homes that were sold in the US In 2017.
